# CV-Project

The objective of this project is to grant students the access to a computer lab based on facial recognition.
It would compare the real-time input and the pictures of students we have in our database to decide if or not access is granted to the certain student,
and assign those with access to a desktop computer in the lab. It will be useful to automate the way students use school resources all while holding full accountability.
